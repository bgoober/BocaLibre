# BocaLibre

An agent-based, peer-to-peer, chat/social messaging application, intended for users with differing languages.

1. Alice speaks Enligsh. Bob Speaks Spanish.

2. Alice types a message in English and sends it to Bob. The original message is sent by Alice's agent to an AI model for translation from English to Spanish.

3. Bob receives Alice's original message in English, and waits for the translation.

4. The translation into Spanish is returned from the model, sent to Bob by Alice's agent, and rendered under the original message in English.

5. Bob see's the translated message in Spanish, and replies in Spanish, and the cycle repeats for each message, by any user.

---

the user adds their hf_api key.

the user inputs a message natively.

the message is sent as a translation request to the HF model by the user's agent.
    formatted: translate X to X: xxxx

the model returns a translation to the user's agent.

the user's agent handles the response, and transforms the reponse into the next message to be sent to the intended recipient address.

the recipient agent handles the message, and logs it.

the second user repeats from step 2.

So we must have:
    - api key input
    - accept input from terminal, repeatably
    - format input into translation request and send to hf model
    - handle response from model
    - format response into message and send to intended recipient
    - handle message from sender and log to display

User Agents:

1. t5_base_hf
    - Handles translation requests and responses to-and-from the remote HF model.
2. t5_base_user
    - Sends request to t5_base_hf agent.
    - Handles responses from the t5_base_hf agent.
    - Sends boca_message to chat partner upon response messages

Non-user Agents:

1. Match_Maker
    - Matches chat participants
    - Handles queue of participant chat requests


Flow:

1. The user connects their Fetch.ai wallet.
2. The user starts their t5_base_hf_agent.
    - This requires a HuggingFace API key from the user.
3. The user starts their t5_base_user agent.
    - This requires the address of the user's t5_base_hf agent from step 2.
    - This requires a declared native language and a translation language from the user.
4. The user makes a chat request to the Match_Maker agent.
5. The Match_Maker matches two users who have matching criteria to initiate a chat between the two agents.
6. The Match_Maker agent responds to the user's agents with the address of the user's agent with whom they have been matched.
7. A user inputs some text.
8. The user's agent sends a TranslationRequest to the user's t5_base_hf agent.
9. The user's t5_base_hf agent receives the request and makes a subsequent TranslationRequest to the remote HuggingFace t5-base model.
10. The user's t5_base_hf agent awaits a response from the model.
11. Upon receiving the translation response from the remote HF model, the t5_base_hf agent sends the TranslationResponse message to the user's t5_base_user agent.
12. Upon receiving this TranslationResponse, the t5_base_user agent sends a BocaMessage to their chat partner.
13. The partner's t5_base_user agent receives the BocaMessage and displays it.
