# BocaLibre

An agent-based, peer-to-peer, chat/social messaging application, intended for users that speak differing native languages.

1. Alice speaks Enligsh. Bob Speaks Spanish. They both want to chat with someone who speaks a different language, so they request a chat partner from the match_maker agent, which matches them.

2. Alice types a message to Bob in English, and it is sent to the t5_base agent for translation to Spanish. She awaits the translated response from the t5_base agent.

3. The TranslationResponse is returned to Alice from the t5_base agent, and a BocaMessage is sent to Bob, containing both the original native message in English, and the translated message in Spanish.

4. Bob receives the BocaMessage from Alice, containing both the English, and Spanish versions of her message.

5. Bob types his response in Spanish, it is translated by t5_base into English, and a new BocaMessage is sent back to Alice.

6. The cycle repeats.

Agentverse Flow:

1. The user navigates to [agentverse.ai](https://agentverse.ai)
2. The user creates a boca_user agent.
3. The user supplies 3 things to their boca_user agent's .env file:
    - Their native language
    - Their target language (the native language of the person they'd like to have a conversation with (Which is also the language their native speech will be translated to)).
    - Their [HUGGING_FACE_ACCESS_TOKEN](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens) as an "Agent Secret"
        - as the "Secret Name", put HUGGING_FACE_ACCESS_TOKEN, and as the "Secret Value", enter your API key.
4. The user starts their boca_user agent.
5. On startup, the user's agent requests a new chat partner from the match_maker agent.
6. The user awaits a match from the match_maker agent.
7. Once a match has been received from the match_maker agent, the user can type a message to their chat partner.
8. The user types a message and it is sent to the t5_base agent to be translated into the target language/native language of their chat partner.
9. The translated message is returned to the user.
10. Both the native message and the translated message are sent to the user's chat partner using a BocaMessage.
11. The chat partner's (user #2) boca_user agent receives the BocaMessage from the sender (user #1).
12. The BocaMessage is displayed to the console of user #2.
13. User #2, the partner, then replies in their native language, and the process repeats from step #8.
